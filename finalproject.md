## General Guidelines 
A computer-controlled experiment that involves data acquisition (with the NI board, an Arduino, a Scope or a parallel port device), display, and analysis. Along your project you will be submitting a design document. [Here](http://1drv.ms/1tlsS5E) is an example design document. This document is a simplified version of [IEEE-1066](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_description).

## Previous Projects
The following are suggestions, some based on previous projects:
	
* Guitar Tuner: a spectrum analyzer for tuning guitars
* Play a sequence of music notes and see if you can follow the keyboard.
* Control the heating and cooling of a thermal electric cooler by temperature sensors  
* For those with some C/C++ experience, there is the possibility of learning to write a DLL to incorporate with LabVIEW. This could be to allow additional analysis of data collected in one of the previous modules.
* Extend measurement of the frequency sweep of the Kundt's tupe to include phase: compare with phase in the ringdown for the same tube.
* Measure normal mode frequencies for physical objects (e.g. a meter stick) using an  accelerometer.
* With an old CRT tube oscilloscop, draw pictures with by detecting the position of the beam spot with a photodiode--a "light pen".
* Develop an asynchronous optical serial transmitter/receiver using a LED and a photodiode
* Dynamically controlled DC motor using load sensing (from a shaft encoder, photodiode or optical interrupter
* Mechanics project using sonic ranger
* Something on dynamics of a forced oscillation -- maybe look for hysterisis in a driven string or LRC
* Phase shift/Amp Shift of filter circuits
* Automated test of Frequency response/falloff of various op-amps
* Slit diffraction experiment
