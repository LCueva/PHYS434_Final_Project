# Notes for 2014 class 

This class differed profoundly from last year, mostly due to the innovations of Durmus Karatay. Specifically:

* New textbook. The Essick text is a much better companion to a class like this. We especially like the DIY exercises

* GitHub and git. This introduced the students to code management and sharing, and was useful way to submit (by pull requests)
of a cloned description of the task.

* No lectures. It was never clear how well the lectures worked

* (Almost) no canned VIs for a starting point. Previously there was a VI that "worked" as a demo of the input and output, but
which required extensive modification to produced the requested output. Now we expect them to already know how to design VIs
for the purpose of the task. This is aided by some of the previous exercises, especially the digital oscilloscope.

* Projects using a formal design document for the proposal and final submission

* Demonstrations and interviews about projects. During Finals week, we scheduled each team for 1/2 hour, most on the last day. This allowed an
assessments of who did what on the team, and how well they understood the basic physics or mathematics.

* Attendance/participation as a part of the grade. This was a useful way to have a subjective component of the overall grade,
based on interactions with the students during the quarter.

# Notes for 2015 class

* The almost universal lack of understanding of time vs. frequency was very disturbing, learned with the interviews. This 
was supposed to be the point of the Kuntz tube exercises. Perhaps there are specific exercies that could help.

* Development of a library of sub VIs could help

* There was not an explicit exercise to introduce shift registers

* Most students did not seem to understand the Waveform object. Needs an exercise or two.
